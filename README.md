A Minecraft map renderer written in C.

Uses the following libraries:
- cNBT - https://github.com/FliPPeh/cNBT
- LodePNG - http://lodev.org/lodepng

Currently does orthographic renders, and isometric renders are planned.

Options so far:
- `-n` - Night render mode.
- `-o [outfile]` - The image file to save to. Defaults to `map.png`.

This happens to be my first C project.
