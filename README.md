A Minecraft map renderer written in C.

Uses the following libraries:
cNBT - https://github.com/FliPPeh/cNBT
LodePNG - http://lodev.org/lodepng

Currently does orthographic renders, and isometric renders are planned.

Not much of an interface yet, but that's coming, and documentation will follow.

This happens to be my first C project.
